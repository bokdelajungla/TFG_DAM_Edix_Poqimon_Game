# Introduction
This is the repository for the TFG DAM course in which we sought to implement a videogame that mimiqued the gameplay from the classic 2D Pokémon games.
The objective was to be able to implement the maximun number of mechanics of the originals using Unity.

In the end we delivered a prototype that imitates:
- World Mechanics:
   - Tile based movement
   - NPC dialogue interactions
   - NPC walking
   - Random encounters with poqimons
   - Trainer Battles triggers
   - Collectible Items
   - Menu options
   - Healer NPC

- Battle Mechanics
  - Turn based combat
  - Experience system
  - Status effects
  - Move replacement system
  - Catching poqimons
  - Escape from figth

- Battle UI
  - HUD
  - Animated and colored HP Bars
  - Animated Exp bar
  - Simple Poqimons and attack animations
  - Attack Sounds

- Other Mechanics:
  - Evolutions
  - Save and Load game state

- Entities:
  - Poqimons with all their stats
  - Moves with almost all properties
